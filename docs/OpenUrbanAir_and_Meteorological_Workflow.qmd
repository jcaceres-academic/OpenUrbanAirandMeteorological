# 1. Purpose of the Notebook

This Quarto Notebook serves as a **teaching and research companion** to the article\
*Citizen Science and STEM Education with R: Reproducible Learning from Open Urban Air Quality Data* (Applied Sciences, 2025).

It reproduces the main analytical workflow implemented in the study and illustrates how R and Quarto can be integrated into **STEM education** to foster data literacy, environmental awareness, and methodological transparency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Reproducible Data Workflow

The complete workflow integrates **open data**, **computational reproducibility**, and **STEM learning**.\
It can be applied to other urban contexts or courses focusing on environmental informatics, statistical modelling, or sustainability transitions.

## üóÇÔ∏è **3. Data Sources and Structure**

# 3. Data Sources and Structure

All datasets were retrieved from the **Madrid Open Data Portal (Ayuntamiento de Madrid)** and the **AEMET** open repository.

Three processing stages were implemented in R:

Each stage is reproducible through the R scripts in `/scripts/`: - `01_preprocessing.R` - `02_validation.R` - `03_parquet_conversion.R`
